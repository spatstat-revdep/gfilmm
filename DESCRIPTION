Description: Simulation of the generalized fiducial distribution for
    normal linear mixed models with interval data. Fiducial inference is
    somehow similar to Bayesian inference, in the sense that it is based
    on a distribution that represents the uncertainty about the
    parameters, like the posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics. It
    does not require a prior distribution, and it yields results close to
    frequentist results. Reference: Cisewski and Hannig (2012)
